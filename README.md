# Multi-Search
Basic Information:
1. Use multiple search engines simultaneously. 
2. It was made with French-English language professionals in mind. 
3. I use windows.

How to make multisearch functional:
1. Open notepad and copy the code into notepad.
2. Save the notepad file.
3. Rename the file extension from ".txt" to ".html".
4. Open the .html file.

How to use:
1. Write what you want in the search bar.
2. Select the search engine you want to use.
3. Press search.
4. Multi-search should open a new tab for each search engine you selected using whatever you wrote in the search bar.
5. Your browser might block multiple tabs from being created. If that happens you'll have to allow it. If you allow it, it should work from that point on. You don't need to refresh the page.

Other Information:
1. The first version of this was made with the help of ChatGPT because I barely know what I'm doing. I then built on it a lot.
2. I chose to make this in html because it works on most web browsers and html is super simple.
